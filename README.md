# SUBURBS SERVICED BY WASTE-WATER TREATMENT PLANT DETECTING GENETIC MATERIAL (SARS-CoV-2) ARE HIGHLY PRONE TO COVID-19 INFECTION SPREAD

### ELABORATION ON THE PROBLEM:
##### Key Question --> *Which suburb/region serviced by wastewater site are potentially at a higher risk of infection?*
Tracking regions in Queensland state that are exposed to the virus (COVID-19) based on the genetic material (SARS-Cov-2) that are frequently detected in waste-water treatment plant servicing them. With the help of Queensland Health waste-water surveillance data, the vulnerable sites identified can then be reported to the respective stakeholders so that timely measures/actions can be taken to control or restrict the disease spread.
