# SUBURBS SERVICED BY WASTE-WATER TREATMENT PLANT DETECTING GENETIC MATERIAL (SARS-CoV-2) ARE HIGHLY PRONE TO COVID-19 INFECTION SPREAD

### ELABORATION ON THE PROBLEM:
##### Key Question --> *Which suburb/region serviced by wastewater site are potentially at a higher risk of infection?*
Tracking regions in Queensland state that are exposed to the virus (COVID-19) based on the genetic material (SARS-Cov-2) that are frequently detected in waste-water treatment plant servicing them. With the help of Queensland Health waste-water surveillance data, the vulnerable sites identified can then be reported to the respective stakeholders so that timely measures/actions can be taken to control or restrict the disease spread.

### ABSTRACT:
Following the evidence of the genetic material SARS-CoV-2 getting detected in the Sewage sludge, it is pertinent to 
develop a relation between the samples detected in a particular treatment plant and the transmission/spread of 
infection in the associated suburbs. A brief description about the wastewater surveillance approach has been 
explained under “Introduction” section of the report. The data analysis performed for the key problem is data 
driven; however, critical analysis is simultaneously done to avoid any confoundedness, erroneousness or biasness in 
the data. The descriptive analysis of the Queensland govt. wastewater surveillance data basically filters out all sites
except those that have recorded the detection count for more than 5 numbers of times, over a period of 6 month 
data. There are 3 analyses done under the descriptive analysis section and the corresponding results along with the 
graphical outcomes have been explained in the “Result” section. Since my primary question was to see whether a
COVID-19 spread in a particular region/suburb is severe, I went further explaining the predictive analysis approach 
with the help of graphs and conditional probability. The predictive analysis is done using Bayesian network technique 
to predict the uncertainty in the variable that estimates high or low risk region based on conditional probability. The 
report provides a key problem and with the help of analysis, draws vital conclusion to curb the potential breakout of 
infection. It becomes very important to share my work with the concerned authorities,
* Public Health Authority (Queensland govt.)
* People associated with wastewater research work
* People working for media house in Queensland \n
  
The problem discovered needs to be addressed to them along with the appropriate analysis so that timely measures 
are taken to mitigate the spread of the disease. Also, to check the list of suburbs serviced by the wastewater plants,
